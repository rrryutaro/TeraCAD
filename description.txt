TeraCAD:
This Mod aims to make it possible to build like CAD.

Currently the use of Paint tools is suspended due to license violation.
For this reason, we are not currently offering substantial functions, so please be patient.

For the future, we plan to provide the following functions.
- Draw underline like CAD
- Place a block with a feeling like drawing a straight line
